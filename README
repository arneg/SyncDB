===== KNOWN BUGS =======================
- LS(prefix)
  * doesnt detect several windows working on the same LS. It should internally
    lock using CAS or poll the fields if its already set.

===== Similar projects and comparison ==

- jStorage (http://www.jstorage.info/)
  * is basically equivalent to our SyncDB.LS object which implements one
    simple key value storage api on top of different browser technologies.
    Supports even IE 6 with up to 128k of storage.
