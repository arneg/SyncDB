key Migration needs:

1) Introduce a syncdb table to keep track of the current schema version
    table_name, version_number, installed timestamp

2) Add version support to SyncDB.Schema, with (optional) hooks for an update
   script (do we need downgrade scripts ?)

3) Add version support to SmartType, which compiles down into the correct
   SyncDB.Schema version

4) Write a backup utility, which stores the Schema versions along with the
   tables (maybe not necessary, since the syncdb table would be included in
   the backup).

Potential issues:

1) The transform_row migration should make sure to also insert automatic
   fields as such. Is this currently supported?
